      <p>Hiii Shieeee, I’ve been admiring you for a while now. Every time I see you, it’s like everything else fades, and you’re the only one I notice.</p>
<br>
<p>
I first saw you back in Doña, but I never thought I’d see you again. Then, when I saw you at CHMSU, something just hit me I realized the feeling never really left. And now, it’s even stronger.
</p>
<br>
<p>
It honestly makes me wonder how can someone like you exist? You have this way of making everyone else seem invisible when you’re around.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I don’t really expect anything I just felt like I needed to say it. UwU ^~~^</p>
